## Objectives
- Set up Laravel project with required packages
- Configure authentication and authorization system
- Implement role-based access control
- Establish database foundation
- Configure development environment

## Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Package Installation & Configuration
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

#### Tasks:
1. **Install Filament 3.x**
   ```bash
   composer require filament/filament:"^3.0"
   php artisan filament:install --panels
   ```

2. **Install Filament Shield (includes Spatie Permission)**
   ```bash
   composer require bezhansalleh/filament-shield
   php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-shield-config"
   ```

3. **Install Spatie Media Library**
   ```bash
   composer require spatie/laravel-medialibrary
   php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\MediaLibrary\MediaLibraryServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
   ```

4. **Install Additional Packages**
   ```bash
   # For file exports
   composer require pxlrbt/filament-excel
   
   # For enhanced forms and tables
   composer require filament/spatie-laravel-settings-plugin
   
   # For activities logging
   composer require spatie/laravel-activitylog
   
   # For PDF generation
   composer require barryvdh/laravel-dompdf
   
   # Context7 MCP for enhanced Filament development (if available)
   # composer require context7/filament-mcp
   ```

#### ✅ COMPLETED Output:
- ✅ All packages installed via Composer
- ✅ Configuration files published
- ✅ Package service providers registered

### 2. Database Setup & Initial Migrations
**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

#### Tasks:
1. **Run Base Migrations**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

2. **Create User Model Modifications**
   - Add `status` enum field to users table
   - Add necessary user-related fields

3. **Verify Database Connection**
   - Test MySQL connection
   - Ensure migration tracking works correctly

#### ✅ COMPLETED Output:
- ✅ Database tables created successfully
- ✅ User model updated with HasRoles trait
- ✅ Migration history established

### 3. Role & Permission System Setup (Filament Shield)
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

#### Tasks:
1. **Install and Configure Filament Shield**
   ```bash
   php artisan shield:install
   ```
   This command will:
   - Publish migrations for roles and permissions
   - Set up the User model with HasRoles trait
   - Create the Shield configuration

2. **Generate Permissions for Resources**
   ```bash
   # After creating Filament resources, generate their permissions
   php artisan shield:generate --all
   ```
   This automatically creates CRUD permissions for all Filament resources.

3. **Define Core Roles in Shield Configuration**
   Update `config/filament-shield.php`:
   ```php
   'super_admin' => [
       'enabled' => true,
       'name' => 'super_admin',
       'define_via_gate' => false,
   ],
   ```

4. **Create Custom Role Seeder**
   ```bash
   php artisan make:seeder RolePermissionSeeder
   ```
   
   Define these roles:
   - `super_admin` - Full system access (auto-generated by Shield)
   - `procurement_officer` - Manage RFQs, vendors, contracts
   - `finance_officer` - Manage invoices, payments, financial reports
   - `vendor` - Limited access to vendor-specific features

5. **Create Super Admin User**
   ```bash
   php artisan shield:super-admin
   ```
   Or create manually:
   - Email: admin@vms.local
   - Default password (to be changed)
   - Assign super_admin role

#### ✅ COMPLETED Output:
- ✅ Filament Shield installed and configured
- ✅ Resource-based permissions framework ready
- ✅ Core business roles defined and seeded
- ✅ Super admin user created with full access
- ✅ User model properly configured with HasRoles trait
- ✅ Shield admin interface available at `/admin/shield/roles`

### 4. Filament Panel Configuration
**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

#### Tasks:
1. **Configure Main Admin Panel**
   ```php
   // config/filament.php or AdminPanel configuration
   - Set branding and colors
   - Configure navigation
   - Set authentication guards
   ```

2. **Create Vendor Panel (Optional for Phase 0)**
   ```bash
   php artisan make:filament-panel vendor
   ```

3. **Configure Authentication**
   - Set up login/logout flows
   - Configure password reset
   - Set up email verification if needed

4. **Basic Dashboard Setup**
   - Create welcome dashboard
   - Add basic navigation structure
   - Configure Shield role/permission management in navigation
   
5. **Enable Shield Resources**
   In your Filament Panel provider:
   ```php
   use BezhanSalleh\FilamentShield\FilamentShieldPlugin;
   
   public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
   {
       return $panel
           ->plugins([
               FilamentShieldPlugin::make()
           ]);
   }
   ```

#### ✅ COMPLETED Output:
- ✅ Filament admin panel accessible at `/admin`
- ✅ Super admin can log in successfully
- ✅ Basic navigation structure visible
- ✅ Dashboard displays correctly
- ✅ Shield role/permission management available
- ✅ Auto-generated resource permissions framework ready

### 5. Development Environment Configuration
**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

#### Tasks:
1. **Configure Laravel Sail Services**
   - Verify MySQL, Redis connections
   - Test file storage (S3 setup for later phases)

2. **Set Up Queue Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Update .env
   QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
   
   # Test queue worker
   php artisan queue:work
   ```

3. **Configure Mail Settings**
   ```bash
   # For development - use Mailpit (already in Sail)
   MAIL_MAILER=smtp
   MAIL_HOST=mailpit
   MAIL_PORT=1025
   ```

4. **Set Up Basic Logging**
   ```php
   // Configure activity logging
   - User login/logout events
   - Permission changes
   ```

#### ✅ COMPLETED Output:
- ✅ Development server running on localhost:8000
- ✅ Queue system functional (sync mode)
- ✅ Mail system configured and tested
- ✅ Basic activity logging packages installed

### 6. Basic Testing Setup
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours

#### Tasks:
1. **Install Pest (if not already installed)**
   ```bash
   composer require pestphp/pest --dev --with-all-dependencies
   php artisan pest:install
   ```

2. **Create Basic Test Structure**
   ```php
   // tests/Feature/AuthenticationTest.php
   // tests/Feature/RolePermissionTest.php
   ```

3. **Set Up Test Database**
   ```php
   // phpunit.xml configuration for testing
   <env name="DB_CONNECTION" value="sqlite"/>
   <env name="DB_DATABASE" value=":memory:"/>
   ```

#### ✅ COMPLETED Output:
- ✅ PHPUnit testing framework configured
- ✅ Basic authentication tests created (2/3 passing)
