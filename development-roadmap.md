## Implementation Guidelines

### Database Naming Conventions
- Tables: plural, snake_case (`vendors`, `rfq_responses`)
- Foreign keys: `{model}_id` (`vendor_id`, `created_by`)
- Pivots: alphabetical order (`rfq_vendors`)
- Indexes on: foreign keys, status fields, date ranges

### Service Layer Pattern
```php
// Each module has a dedicated service class
VendorOnboardingService::class
RFQService::class
ContractService::class
InvoiceService::class
ReportingService::class
```

### Permission Structure
```php
// Format: {action}_{resource}
'view_vendors', 'manage_vendors', 'approve_vendors'
'create_rfqs', 'manage_rfqs', 'respond_to_rfqs'
'manage_contracts', 'view_contracts'
'approve_invoices', 'manage_payments'
```

### Testing Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage per phase
- Feature tests for all workflows
- Unit tests for business logic
- Policy tests for authorization

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| Package conflicts | High | Lock versions in composer.json |
| Performance issues | Medium | Implement caching early, optimize queries |
| File storage limits | Medium | Use S3 for production |
| Email delivery | Low | Use queue for notifications |

### Business Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| Scope creep | High | Strict phase gates, clear success criteria |
| User adoption | Medium | Training materials, intuitive UI |
| Data migration | Medium | Plan migration scripts early |

---

## Key Decisions

### Architecture Choices
1. **Filament for Admin UI:** Rapid development, built-in components
2. **Spatie Packages:** Industry standard, well-maintained
3. **Service Layer:** Business logic separation from controllers
4. **Repository Pattern:** Not used - Eloquent is sufficient
5. **API:** Not in initial scope - Filament handles all UI

### Workflow Decisions
1. **Vendor Approval:** Required before system access
2. **RFQ Response:** Only invited vendors can participate
3. **Invoice Approval:** Manual review by finance team
4. **Contract Creation:** Automatic from RFQ award
